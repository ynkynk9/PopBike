# PopBike 
=====
This is my thesis project. It is a project with three parts which uses data visualization to tell a story about the relationship of people and bikes.

“Pop Bike” is a project, which creates a set of real-time interactive data visualizations using bike, museum and census data feeds for New York City. It uses a map with bike stations, museums, and bicycle routes to illustrate the current situation of bicycles in New York; an interactive chord diagram for displaying the check-in and check-out of bikes among stations; and a real-time snapshot of bike trips. The goal of these visualizations is to tell a story about the relationship between people and bikes in NYC, and to create an interactive digital tool to help analyze Citi Bike statistics in New York.

Data visualization is a technique of data analysis and processing that uses pictorial or graphical formats, for example, pie charts, scatterplots, and maps. Visualizations can be drawn and printed on paper, and made by computer; they can be 2D, 3D and/or interactive.

Popbike Goals
----------------
        Illustrate the relationship between bike use and demographics     
        Make static data spatial and dynamic   
        Help people know about NYC transit and tourist options through data visualization

Data in the Modern Age
-----------------------
        After the novel, and subsequently cinema privileged narrative as the key form of cultural expression of the
        modern age, the computer age introduces its correlate- the database.        — Lev Manovich

Design Goals
----------------------
        Interactivity
          users can show and hide layers with check-boxes
        Give users access underlying data                 
          use tooltips to display numeric data
        Show tourism data
          use Panoramio image layer
        
Data Sets

        Neighborhood data from US Census
        Bike-use data from Citi Bike
        Income data from Zipatlas
        Weather data from World Weather Online
